# ODI Open Data Certificate

The [ODI's Open Data Certificate](http://theodi.github.com/open-data-certificate/certificate.html) specifies what good open data looks like in four main categories:

  * **Legal Information** about the licence, ownership and privacy implications of the data
  * **Practical Information** about the timeliness, quality and sustainability of the data
  * **Technical Information** about where the data can be found and its format
  * **Social Information** about how to engage with the data owner and others about the data
  
A certificate can be awarded at one of four levels:

  * **Basic Certificate** for data that meets the bare minimum to classify as open data
  * **Bronze Certificate** for open data that provides the minimum of what reusers need
  * **Silver Certificate** for open data that provides a good base for reuse
  * **Gold Certificate** for outstanding open data

The aims of the ODI's Open Data Certificate are:

  * to provide data owners with something they can point to that shows how well they are doing open data
  * to provide data owners with ideas about how they could improve the way in which they are publishing or supporting open data
  * to provide data consumers with useful information about the data, helping them to engage with it
  * to provide the open data community with on-going metrics about open data publication

Best practices in open data will change as time goes on. Certificates will only be valid for a year, to prompt data publishers to continue to improve their provision.

## Alpha Version
  
The [current version](http://theodi.github.com/open-data-certificate/certificate.html) is an **alpha version**. We are seeking feedback on:

  * whether it asks the right questions
  * whether the bronze/silver/gold classification is correct
  * the usability of the form

We are particularly looking for feedback from data publishers who attempt to use the tool to create a certificate for their own data.

Let us know what you think by emailing [certificate@theodi.org](mailto:certificate@theodi.org) or adding issues to this project.

Our longer-term aims are to provide back-end support for the certificate which would include:

  * automatically populating answers based on information available about the dataset at the documentation URL
  * automatically validating the answers that are provided
  * storing a copy of the completed certificates, and providing search and social interfaces over them

These requirements, and the avoidance of double-entry for data publishers, are behind the decision to request links for much of the information that is requested by the form.

## Technical Information

The HTML certificate is generated by transforming `certificate.xml` with `certificate.xsl` using an XSLT 2.0 processor such as [Saxon](http://saxonica.com).

The certificate uses [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) to support its dynamic user interface and, of course, [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for styling.

## Known Issues

  * The certificate itself does not get populated with all the information that you enter within the form.

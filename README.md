## ODI Open Data Certificate

The original prototype has been moved to [/prototype](https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/tree/master/prototype).

### Surveyor

The Open Data Certificate uses [surveyor](https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor) to generate and display the data questionnaires.  We've changed the look, feel & structure to fit the site and extended it to support certificate levels.

#### Deploying questionnaires

Any changed surveys can be generated by running a rake task:

    # build all surveys in ./surveys
    rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys

    # specify a survey directory
    rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys DIR=surveys/development

The approach to the new app is outlined in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/whiteoctober.co.uk/document/d/1Ot91x1enq9TW7YKpePytE-wA0r8l9dmNQLVi16ph-zg/edit#), which will be moved into this readme file.
